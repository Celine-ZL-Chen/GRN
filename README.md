# GRN

Class 1: assume TF expression = TF activity
So far, only focus on CDKN1A and its TFs
testing method: 20 TFs for training, 10 TFs for testing
calculate normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) for evaluation

model 0 - univariate linear model
uni_reg_cdkn1a.R

model 1 - multivariate linear model
multi_reg_cdkn1a.R

model 2 - multivariate lasso model (glmnet)
lasso_cdkn1a.R

model 3 - multivariate non-local prior model (mombf)
mombf_cdkn1a.R

â€ŒClass 2: infer TF activity from target genes' expression
* mean expression of target genes (DoRothEA) as activity of TF [no normalization performed]
Summerized GTEX data [pick out all activities of the TF]
